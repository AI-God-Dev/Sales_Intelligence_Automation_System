# Sales Rep Daily Usage Guide

Your guide to using Sales Intelligence for daily prospecting and account management.

## Morning Routine (5-10 minutes)

### 1. Check Priority Dashboard

Open the web app and review the **Dashboard** page:

1. **Top Priority Accounts** - Focus on accounts with scores 80+
2. **Recent Activity** - See which accounts had recent emails/calls
3. **Unmatched Emails** - Quick wins for lead creation

**Action**: Note your top 5 accounts for today's focus.

### 2. Review Account Scores

Go to **Account Scoring** page:

- **Priority Score** (80-100): Hot - requires immediate attention
- **Priority Score** (60-79): Warm - schedule follow-up this week
- **Priority Score** (40-59): Nurture - add to sequence
- **Budget Likelihood**: Higher = more likely to have budget now
- **Engagement Score**: Higher = more responsive recently

**Pro Tip**: Sort by "Budget Likelihood" when looking for quick closes.

## Daily Tasks

### Finding Conversation Context

Before calling or emailing an account:

1. Go to **Account Details**
2. Search for the account name
3. Review tabs:
   - **Emails** - Recent email history
   - **Calls** - Call transcripts and notes
   - **Opportunities** - Current deals

**What to look for**:
- Last contact date
- Topics discussed
- Pain points mentioned
- Budget discussions
- Decision timeline

### Using Semantic Search

When you need to find specific conversations:

1. Go to **Semantic Search**
2. Enter what you're looking for (not keywords, but intent):
   - "budget discussions for next year"
   - "concerns about implementation timeline"
   - "competitor mentions"
   - "pricing objections"

3. Filter by type (emails, calls, accounts)
4. Review matching results

**Example Searches**:

| What You Need | Search Query |
|---------------|--------------|
| Budget timing | "when will budget be available" |
| Decision makers | "who else needs to be involved" |
| Pain points | "challenges with current solution" |
| Urgency signals | "need to make a decision soon" |

### Generating Email Replies

When you need help crafting a response:

1. Go to **Email Threads**
2. Search for the thread by email address
3. Review the conversation
4. Click **Generate Reply** on the message you're replying to
5. Edit the AI suggestion to add your personal touch
6. Copy and send from your email client

**Tips for AI replies**:
- The AI uses conversation history for context
- Always personalize before sending
- Check facts and figures
- Add your signature

### Creating Leads from Unmatched Emails

When you find emails from new prospects:

1. Go to **Unmatched Emails**
2. Click **Load Unmatched Emails**
3. Review each email:
   - Check if it's a real prospect (not spam/vendor)
   - Verify company looks legitimate
4. Select promising leads
5. Click **Create Leads from Selected**

Leads are automatically created in Salesforce with:
- Source: "AI Inbound Email"
- Description: Original email content
- Your ownership

## Ask Questions in Plain English

Use **Natural Language Query** for quick insights:

**Example Questions**:
```
"Show me accounts I haven't contacted in 30 days"
"Which accounts have open opportunities over $50k?"
"List contacts at [Company Name]"
"What accounts are in the renewal stage?"
"Show me my top 10 accounts by engagement"
```

**Tips**:
- Be specific with what you want
- Include time frames
- Ask for specific fields you need

## Weekly Review (15 minutes)

Every week, review:

1. **Accounts scored but not contacted**
   - Query: "Show high priority accounts with no activity this week"

2. **Stale opportunities**
   - Check Account Details for deals with no recent activity

3. **Unmatched emails backlog**
   - Clear out leads that should be created

4. **Search patterns**
   - Use semantic search for "ready to buy" or "urgent need"
