# Sales Intelligence Dashboard  
## Sales Rep Quick Start Guide

Welcome! This tool helps you decide **who to focus on and what to do next** — without digging through inboxes or CRM tabs.

You do NOT need to configure anything.  
Just use it daily.

---

## What This Tool Is
The Sales Intelligence Dashboard shows:
- Which accounts are most important **right now**
- Recent inbound activity you should follow up on
- AI-generated summaries of conversations
- Accounts discussing budget, timelines, or opportunities

Think of it as your **daily prioritization assistant**.

---

## How to Use It (Daily Workflow)

### 🌅 Morning Routine (5–10 minutes)
1. Open the **Sales Intelligence Dashboard**
2. Start on the **Priority / Dashboard view**
3. Review:
   - Top prioritized accounts
   - New or recent inbound activity
4. Click into 1–2 accounts:
   - Read the summary
   - Review the recommended next action
5. Take action:
   - Reply to email
   - Follow up in Salesforce
   - Enroll in a HubSpot sequence if appropriate

That’s it.

### 🔍 During the Day (As Needed)
Use **Search** to find:
- “accounts discussing budget”
- “accounts mentioning 2026”
- “accounts with recent calls”

This replaces manual searching in email or CRM.

---

## What You Should NOT Do
- Do NOT trigger data syncs
- Do NOT modify settings
- Do NOT worry about how the AI works
- Do NOT expect this to replace Salesforce

This tool **supports** your workflow — it doesn’t replace your CRM.

---

## When to Trust the Tool
- Use it to **prioritize**
- Use it to **spot missed follow-ups**
- Use it to **focus your time**

If something looks off:
- Flag it to your manager
- Do NOT try to fix it yourself

---

## One Rule to Remember
> **If the dashboard helps you decide who to contact today, it’s doing its job.**
