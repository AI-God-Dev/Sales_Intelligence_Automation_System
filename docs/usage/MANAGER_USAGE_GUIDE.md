# Sales Intelligence Dashboard  
## Manager Usage Guide

This guide explains how sales managers should use the Sales Intelligence Dashboard for **visibility, coaching, and prioritization**.

This is NOT a daily execution tool for managers.

---

## What This Tool Gives Managers
- A prioritized view of accounts
- Insight into recent activity
- Signals for risk and opportunity
- A shared source of truth for conversations

This replaces subjective or gut-based reviews.

---

## Weekly Manager Workflow

### 📊 Weekly Review
1. Open the dashboard
2. Sort accounts by:
   - Priority score
   - Recent activity
3. Review:
   - Which accounts are heating up
   - Which accounts lack follow-up
   - Why certain accounts are prioritized

---

### 🧠 Coaching Conversations
Use the dashboard to ask:
- “Why is this account high priority?”
- “What happened after this inbound?”
- “Why hasn’t this been followed up yet?”

The goal is **coaching**, not policing.

---

## What Managers Should NOT Do
- Do NOT micro-manage daily rep activity
- Do NOT expect perfect AI predictions
- Do NOT treat scores as absolute truth

The dashboard provides **signals**, not commands.

---

## Using This in Pipeline Reviews
- Use insights to guide discussion
- Use summaries to save time
- Use consistency to align the team

This tool makes pipeline reviews **faster and more objective**.

---

## If Something Looks Wrong
- Report it to the admin
- Do NOT adjust data manually
- Do NOT bypass the system

---

## Manager Success Metric
This tool is successful if:
- Reps use it daily
- Follow-ups happen faster
- Pipeline discussions become clearer
